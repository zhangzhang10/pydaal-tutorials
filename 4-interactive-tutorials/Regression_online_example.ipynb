    "# Online Ridge Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial brief\n",
    "This tutorial is an example of using ridge regression algorithms from pyDAAL to build predictive models.\n",
    "We use the well-studied Boston House Prices dataset to train ridge regression model in online processiong mode. We  test the accuracy of these models in median house price prediction. The code for ridge regression model training and prediction is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "* To understand how to process the data that doen not fit into memory using online computing mode. \n",
    "* To understand and practice the typical code sequence of using pyDAAL for supervised learning.\n",
    "* To practice interactions and conversions between DAAL NumericTables and NumPy ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear regression introduction\n",
    "Supervised learning involves training a model using the data that has known responses, and then apply the model to predict responses for unseen data. In the case of **linear regression** and **ridge regression**, the model is linear. That is, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{\\beta}(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\cdots, \\beta_k$ are the regression model coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "pyDAAL provides two linear regression algorithms:\n",
    "* **Multiple Linear Regression**: The model is trained by minimizing an objective function in the form of **Residual Sum of Squares**. pyDAAL supports two ways to train the model: 1) Normal Equation method, and 2) QR method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n\\left ( y_i - f_{\\beta}(X^i)\\right )^2 $$  \n",
    "* **Ridge Regression**: It is similar to multiple linear regression, but adds a regularization term to the objective function. The regularization term penalizes features with large values, thus makes the model less prone to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n\\left ( y_i - f_{\\beta}(X^i)\\right )^2 + \\lambda \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^k \\beta_j^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online processing mode\n",
    "Some Intel DAAL algorithms enable processing of data sets in blocks. In the online processing mode, the `compute()`, and `finalizeCompute()` methods of a particular algorithm class are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This computation mode assumes that the data arrives in blocks i = 1, 2, 3, … nBlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the `compute()` method each time new input becomes available.\n",

    "\n",
