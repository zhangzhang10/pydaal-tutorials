We use the well-studied Boston House Prices dataset to train a basic multiple linear regression model, and then a Ridge regression model. We  test the performance of these models in median house price prediction. The code for multiple linear regression model training and prediction is provided. You are required to write the code for Ridge regression model training and prediction.\n",

    "To fit a good linear model, we usually need to carefully decide which features to be included as explanatory variables. Features that are not statistically significant should be excluded. Features that are highly correlated among themselves should also be excluded. Feature selection is an important topic by itself. But it is beyond the scope of this tutorial. For our purposes, let's just say we exclude `indus`, `age`, `zn`, `tax`, and `rad`. This leaves `crim`, `chas`, `nox`, `rm`, `dis`, `ptratio`, `b`, and `lstat` as the explanatory variables. These are corresponding to column indices 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12 in the data. Later, when loading data into memory we'll choose only these columns."
